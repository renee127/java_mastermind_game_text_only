# java_mastermind_game_text_only

The final project of an Introduction to Java programming class involved creating
a text based solution to the classic mastermind game. We did not cover OOP or classes
during the semester, so the program reflects those limitations. Still, I found it
a great exercise in breaking a big problem down into many smaller problems and 
writing separate functions for each.
