Mastermind Game Rules

The goal is to figure out the 3 color code chosen by the computer.
The computer randomly selects a 3 color code from 5 color options
(Red/Blue/White/Yellow/Green). There can be duplicates.
Examples of computer codes: W W B (white white blue) or R B Y (red blue yellow)

The player has 10 guesses to break the code.
The player enters a code guess with the 3 letters of the colors.
The player might enter B B B or Y B W or any other combination.

If the player's guess matches the computer's code, they win.
Otherwise, the computer compares the codes and provides feedback:
It displays 3 pins, either R (red pin), W (white pin) or O (no pin).

If the player has the right color in the right position, an R is shown.
If the player has the right color in the wrong position, a W is shown.
If the player has neither the right color or position, an O is shown.

The position of the R, W or O in the Pin Feedback doesn't indicate the
location. All Rs are listed before all Ws and then the Os are listed.

Some examples:
Computer's Code	Player's Guess	Pin Feedback
R W Y		R W Y		R R R
Y Y Y		B G B		O O O
G B G		B G G		R W O
W G Y		Y W R		W W O
B B B		G B B		R R O
Y G R		R Y G		O O O

A sample game:

Player's Guess	Pin Feedback	 
B B B		R O O		 
B Y Y		W O O		 
W B W		R R O		 
W B G		R W O		 
R B W		R R R
